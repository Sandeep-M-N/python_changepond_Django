<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hello! I'm Sandeep Rao, a passionate software developer with a knack for turning complex problems into elegant, efficient solutions. With 1 years of experience in front-end and backend, I’ve honed my skills in a variety of programming languages and frameworks, including java,python,react.js,django,mysql,postgresql.

    My journey in software development began with a curiosity for how things work, and this curiosity has driven me to continuously learn and evolve in this ever-changing field. Whether it's developing a robust backend system, crafting a seamless user interface, or optimizing code for performance, I strive to build software that not only meets the requirements but also exceeds expectations.
