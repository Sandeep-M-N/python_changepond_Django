               settings.py
               urls.py
               wsgi.py
               asgi.py
    manage.py
      mangae.py:
                ->it is a command-line utitlity for our project
                ->the file contains the code for running the server, make migrations... and several commands
                ->it lets you to interact with your project

    settings.py:
